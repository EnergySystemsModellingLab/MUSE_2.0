title: Model parameters
description: Parameters which affect the behaviour of the model. Most are optional.
type: object
properties:
  milestone_years:
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer
    description: The milestone years for the simulation
    notes: Must be positive integers that are sorted and unique
  candidate_asset_capacity:
    type: number
    description: Capacity to give to candidate assets in dispatch optimisation
    default: 0.0001
    notes: |
      The default value should work. Do not change this value unless you know what you're doing!
  capacity_limit_factor:
    type: number
    description: A factor which constrains the maximum capacity given to candidate assets
    default: 0.1
    notes: |
      This is the proportion of the maximum required capacity across time slices (for a given
      asset/commodity etc. combination).
  pricing_strategy:
    type: string
    enum: [shadow_prices, scarcity_adjusted]
    description: Change the algorithm used for calculating commodity prices
    default: shadow_prices
    notes: |
      The `shadow_prices` option just uses the shadow prices for commodity prices.

      The `scarcity_adjusted` option adjusts prices for scarcity. This may cause price instability
      for assets with more than one output commodity. Do not use this unless you know what you're
      doing!
  value_of_lost_load:
    type: number
    description: The cost applied to unmet demand
    default: 1e9
    notes: |
      The VoLL parameter is used both for the appraisal step and, if `allow_unmet_demand` is set, to
      the main dispatch optimisation.
  max_ironing_out_iterations:
    type: number
    description: The maximum number of times the ironing loop for agent investment will run
    default: 100
  allow_unmet_demand:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether to continue the simulation even if there is unmet demand
    default: false
    notes: |
      The simulation will be penalised with the value of lost load for every unit of unmet demand
required: [milestone_years]
