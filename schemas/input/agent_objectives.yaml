  Describes the agents' objectives.

notes:
  - Every agent must have one objective for each milestone year.
  - If the weighted sum decision rule is in use, the `decision_weight` value must be provided,
    otherwise it must be omitted.
  - If the lexico decision rule is in use, the `decision_lexico_order` value must be provided,

      Must be `npv` (net present value) or `lcox` (levelised cost of X). Note that support for NPV
      is experimental and may give bad results.
