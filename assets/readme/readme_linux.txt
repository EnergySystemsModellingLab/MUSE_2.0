This folder contains the MUSE 2.0 executable for Linux, called `muse2`.

The only pre-requisite is libstdc++.so, which is likely installed on your system already. If not,
you can install with your package manager, e.g. for Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install libstdc++6

For more information on how to use MUSE 2.0, you can consult the program help:

    ./muse2 help

Documentation is also available on the web:
