/// - Generic activity costs: Activity-related costs not tied to a specific SED/SVD output
///   (variable operating costs, cost of purchasing inputs, plus all levies and flow costs not
///   associated with specific SED/SVD outputs). These are shared over all SED/SVD
///   outputs according to their flow coefficients.
/// - Commodity-specific activity costs: flow costs/levies for the specific SED/SVD output.
///
/// ---
///
/// For example, consider an asset A(SED) -> B(SED) + 2C(SED) + D(OTH), with the following costs:
/// - Variable operating cost: 5 per unit activity
/// - Production levy on C: 3 per unit flow
/// - Production levy on D: 4 per unit flow
/// - Price of A: 1 per unit flow
///
/// Then:
/// - Generic activity cost per activity = (1 + 5 + 4) = 10
/// - Generic activity cost per SED/SVD output = 10 / (1 + 2) = 3.333
/// - Marginal cost of B = 3.333
/// - Marginal cost of C = 3.333 + 3 = 6.333
///
/// ---
///
/// For each region, the price in each time slice is taken from the installed asset with the highest
/// marginal cost. If there are no producers of the commodity in that region (in particular, this
/// may occur when there's no demand for the commodity), then candidate assets are considered: we
/// take the price from the candidate asset with the _lowest_ marginal cost, assuming full
/// utilisation (i.e. the single candidate asset that would be most competitive if a small amount of
/// demand was added).
///
/// For commodities with seasonal/annual time slice levels, marginal costs are weighted by

/// - Annual capital costs/fixed operating costs: Calculated based on the capacity of the asset
///   and the total annual output. If an asset has multiple SED/SVD outputs, then these costs are
///   shared equally over all outputs according to their flow coefficients.
/// - Generic activity costs: Activity-related costs not tied to a specific SED/SVD output
///   (variable operating costs, cost of purchasing inputs, plus all levies and flow costs not
///   associated with specific SED/SVD outputs). As above, these are shared over all SED/SVD
///   outputs according to their flow coefficients.
/// - Commodity-specific activity costs: flow costs/levies for the specific SED/SVD output.
///
/// ---
///
/// For example, consider an asset A(SED) -> B(SED) + 2C(SED) + D(OTH), with the following costs:
/// - Annual capital cost + fixed operating cost: 2.5 per unit capacity
/// - Variable operating cost: 5 per unit activity
/// - Production levy on C: 3 per unit flow
/// - Production levy on D: 4 per unit flow
/// - Price of A: 1 per unit flow
///
/// If capacity is 4 and annual activity is 2:
/// - Annual capital + fixed operating cost per activity = (2.5 * 4) / 2 = 5
/// - Annual capital + fixed operating cost per SED/SVD output = 5 / (1 + 2) = 1.666
/// - Generic activity cost per activity = (1 + 5 + 4) = 10
/// - Generic activity cost per SED/SVD output = 10 / (1 + 2) = 3.333
/// - Full cost of B = 1.666 + 3.333 = 5.0
/// - Full cost of C = 1.666 + 3.333 + 3 = 8.0
///
/// ---
///
/// For each region, the price in each time slice is taken from the installed asset with the highest
/// full cost (excluding assets with zero annual activity, as the full cost of these as calculated
/// above would be infinite). If there are no producers of the commodity in that region (in
/// particular, this may occur when there's no demand for the commodity), then candidate assets are
/// considered: we take the price from the candidate asset with the _lowest_ full cost, assuming
/// maximum possible dispatch (i.e. the single candidate asset that would be most competitive if a
/// small amount of demand was added).
///
/// For commodities with seasonal/annual time slice levels, costs are weighted by activity (or the
/// maximum potential activity for candidates) to get a time slice-weighted average cost for each
/// asset, before taking the max across assets. Consequently, the price of these commodities is
/// flat within each season/year.
