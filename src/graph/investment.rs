/// 1. Initialise an `InvestmentGraph` from the set of original `CommodityGraph`s for the given
///    year, filtering to only include SVD/SED commodities. `CommodityGraph`s from
///    all regions are combined into a single `InvestmentGraph`. TODO: at present there can be no
///    edges between regions; in future we will want to implement trade as edges between regions,
///    but this will have no impact on the following steps.
/// 2. Condense strongly connected components (cycles) into `MarketSet::Cycle` nodes.
/// 3. Perform a topological sort on the condensed graph.
/// 4. Compute layers for investment based on the topological order, grouping independent sets into
///    `MarketSet::Layer`s.
///
/// Arguments:
/// * `graphs` - Commodity graphs for each region and year, outputted from `build_commodity_graphs_for_model`

///

/// `MarketSet::Cycle`s and independent sets grouped into `MarketSet::Layer`s.

/// Order the members of each strongly connected component using a mixed-integer linear program.
///
/// `condensed_graph` contains the SCCs detected in the original investment graph, stored as
/// `Vec<MarketSet>` node weights. Single-element components are already acyclic, but components
/// with multiple members require an internal ordering so that the investment algorithm can treat
/// them as near-acyclic chains, minimising potential disruption.
///
/// To rank the members of each multi-node component, we construct a mixed integer linear program
/// (MILP). This MILP is adapted from the classical Linear Ordering Problem:
///
/// Marti, Rafael, and G Reinelt.
/// The Linear Ordering Problem: Exact and Heuristic Methods in Combinatorial Optimization.
/// 1st ed. 2011. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2011. Web.
///
/// The main features of the MILP are:
/// * Binary variables `x[i][j]` represent whether market `i` should appear before market `j`.
/// * Antisymmetry constraints force each pair `(i, j)` to choose exactly one direction (i.e. if
///   `i` comes before `j`, then `j` cannot be before `i`).
/// * Transitivity constraints prevent 3-cycles, ensuring the resulting relation is acyclic (i.e. if
///   `i` comes before `j` and `j` comes before `k`, then `k` cannot come before `i`).
/// * The objective minimises the number of “forward” edges (edges that would point from an earlier
///   market to a later one), counted within the original SCC and treated as unit penalties. A small
///   bias (<1) is added to nudge exporters earlier without outweighing the main objective (a bias
///   >1 would instead prioritise exporters even if it created extra conflicts in the final order).
///
/// Once the MILP is solved, markets are scored by the number of pairwise “wins” (how many other
/// markets they precede). Sorting by this score — using the original index as a tiebreaker to keep
/// relative order stable — yields the final sequence that replaces the SCC in the condensed graph.
/// At least one pairwise mismatch is always inevitable (e.g. where X is solved before Y, but Y may
/// consume X, so the demand for X cannot be guaranteed upfront).
///
/// # Example
///
/// Suppose three markets (A, B and C) form a cycle in the original graph with the following edges:
///
/// ```text
/// A ← B ← C ← A
/// ```
///
/// Additionally, C has an outgoing edge to a node outside the cycle.
///
/// The costs matrix in the MILP is set up to penalise any edge that points “forward” in the final
/// order: if there's an edge from X to Y we prefer to place Y before X so the edge points backwards:
///
/// ```text
///    |   | A | B | C |
///    | A | 0 | 0 | 1 |
///    | B | 1 | 0 | 0 |
///    | C | 0 | 1 | 0 |
/// ```
///
/// On top of this, we give a small preference to markets that export outside the SCC, so nodes with
/// outgoing edges beyond the cycle are pushed earlier. This is done via an `EXTERNAL_BIAS`
/// parameter (B) applied to the cost matrix:
///
/// ```text
///    |   | A | B | C     |
///    | A | 0 | 0 | 1 + B |  i.e. extra penalty for putting A before C
///    | B | 1 | 0 | 0 + B |  i.e. extra penalty for putting B before C
///    | C | 0 | 1 | 0     |
/// ```
///
/// Solving this problem with binary decision variables for each `x[i][j]`, and constraints to enforce
/// antisymmetry and transitivity, yields optimal decision variables of:
///
/// ```text
///    x[A][B] = 1 (A before B)
///    x[A][C] = 0 (C before A)
///    x[B][A] = 0 (A before B)
///    x[B][C] = 0 (C before B)
///    x[C][A] = 1 (C before A)
///    x[C][B] = 1 (C before B)
/// ```
///
/// From these, summing the number of times each market is preferred over another gives an optimal
/// order of:
///
/// ```text
/// C, A, B
/// ```
///
/// * By scheduling C before A before B, the edges C ← A and A ← B incur no cost because their
///   targets appear earlier than their sources.
/// * The preference towards having exporter markets early in the order keeps C at the front.
/// * As with any SCC, at least one pairwise violation is guaranteed. In this ordering, the only
///   pairwise violation is between B and C, as C is solved before B, but B may consume C.
///
/// The resulting order replaces the original `MarketSet::Cycle` entry inside the condensed
/// graph, providing a deterministic processing sequence for downstream logic.
